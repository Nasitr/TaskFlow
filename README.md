 Introduction
 In today’s fast-paced and highly collaborative work environments, effective project
 management is essential for the successful completion of tasks and achievement of
 organizational goals. A Project Management System (PMS) is a software tool designed to help
 individuals and teams plan, execute, monitor, and control projects efficiently. It serves as a
 centralized platform where project managers and team members can collaborate, track
 progress, allocate resources, and ensure that projects are completed on time.
 Key Features of the Project
 Staff List:
 View and manage a comprehensive list of all team members involved in various
 projects.
 Track the roles, responsibilities, and availability of each staff member.
 Assign users to specific tasks and projects, ensuring clear accountability and efficient
 resource allocation.
 Project List:
 Display a detailed list of all ongoing and completed projects within the organization.
 View essential project details such as project name, start date, end date, project
 manager, and current status (e.g., Planning, In Progress, Completed).
 Filter and search for specific projects based on criteria like deadlines, status, or
 assigned team members for quick access to relevant information.
 Task List:
 Track and manage tasks associated with each project in a centralized location.
 Assign tasks to specific team members with clear deadlines and priorities.
 View task details, including descriptions, due dates, status (e.g., To-Do, In Progress,
 Completed), and assigned staff.
 Update and monitor task progress in real-time, ensuring transparency and timely
 completion of work.
 User-Friendly Interface:
 Provide an intuitive and easy-to-navigate interface for all users, reducing the learning
 curve and enhancing adoption.
 Ensure mobile-friendly access for on-the-go project management and updates.
 User-Friendly Interface:
 Provide an intuitive and easy-to-navigate interface for all users, reducing the learning
 curve and enhancing adoption.
 
 Problem Statement
 Outdated project management methods like spreadsheets and emails cause inefficiencies,
 missed deadlines, and poor resource allocation, highlighting the need for modern solutions.
 As organizations grow, communication gaps, inconsistent tracking, and unclear goals further
 hinder productivity, making integrated tools essential for streamlined workflows and team
 alignment.

 Non-Functional Requirements
 1.Performance- The system should load pages and display project/task information within 3 seconds.- The application should be able to handle multiple simultaneous users without significant
 performance degradation.
 2. Scalability- The system should be scalable to accommodate growing teams and an increasing number
 of projects and tasks.
 3. Security- All user data (passwords, personal information) should be encrypted and stored securely.- Ensure that the system is protected against common vulnerabilities like SQL injection,
 cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).- 
Implement role-based access control to ensure users can only access data they’re
 authorized to view.
